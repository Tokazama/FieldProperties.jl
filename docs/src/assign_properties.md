# Assigning Properties

`@properties` makes it easy to create new properties for a given type. Conceptually, it allows one to create a type structure that has fields focused on efficient design and then provide a user facing set of properties to access them. It may be useful to define a set of methods using `@defprop` and then assign the relevant fields to a custom structure.
