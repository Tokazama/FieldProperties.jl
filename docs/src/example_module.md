# ExampleModule

The following docstring was generated using the `GETPROPERTY` and `SETPROPERTY` abbreviations.
These are an extension of `DocStringExtensions` that insert docstrings from `@properties` into a list.
The actually code used to generate this can can be found in `docs/ExampleModuele/src/ExampleModuele.jl`.
